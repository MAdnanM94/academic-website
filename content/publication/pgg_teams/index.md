abstract: Decisions pertaining to the provision of public goods, as well as imposition of sanctions to curb free riding, are often undertaken by groups rather than individuals. We experimentally investigate the behavior of teams in a public goods game with costly/monetary and verbal/non-monetary punishment. Teams of two take part in a finitely repeated public goods game with and without punishment. Absent of punishment, we find that similar contribution levels across teams and individuals. We find that monetary punishment is effective in significantly raising contribution levels when decision makers are both teams and individuals, with teams nearly reaching the socially optimum level of maximum contributions. Non-monetary punishment is effective in raising contributions when decision makers are individuals. However, in sharp contrast to the above, behavior in teams appears to be unaffected under the threat of non-monetary punishment, with contributions declining sharply in the final periods of the experiment. We find no difference in Punishment behavior between teams and individuals under monetary punishment. However, net benefits are higher under monetary punishment (compared to non-monetary punishment) when DMs are teams. <br><br> (*joint with [John Kagel](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kagel.4/) and Christina Gore*)

summary: (*joint with [John Kagel](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kagel.4/) and Christina Gore*)<br><br> We investigate behavior in Public Goods Games under both monetary and non-monetary punishment options with teams of two as decision makers. We find that teams are  teams contribute significantly lower under non-monetary punishment, compared to monetary punishment.
