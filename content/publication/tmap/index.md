abstract: We apply a mechanism design approach to the time minimization assignment problem studied in the operations research literature. A group of workers is to be assigned to tasks. Workers have preferences over tasks as well as scores that determine their compatibility with the tasks. Tasks have a priority schedule that is dependent on the workersâ€™ scores. We introduce a notion of time taken to complete a task based on the weakest link principle and use the metric of time minimization as a means of comparison. We look at existing matching mechanisms and compare how they perform in terms of notions of stability and time minimization. We find inconclusive evidence of a particular mechanism outperforming the others in this regard

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: <br> We analyze the time minimization assignment problem through the lens of matching theory to incorporate notions of stability. We find inconclusive evidence of any particular mechanism outperforming any others.
