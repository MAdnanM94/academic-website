abstract: I experimentally investigate behavior in a game with strategic substitutes using the Global Games paradigm of Carlsson and van Damme (1993). Leveraging uniqueness results from Harrison and Jara-Moroni (2020), I design an experiment to investigate strategic behavior in a market-entry setting under payoff certainty (complete information) and payoff uncertainty (incomplete information).
